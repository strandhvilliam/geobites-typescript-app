# GeoBites


### Description
GeoBites: Your Personal Restaurant Map!

As a Java developer, I wanted to try my hand at creating a front-end project using TypeScript. GeoBites is a restaurant tracking app that allows you to navigate a map and pin locations of restaurants you have visited, along with ratings, descriptions, and more.

This project was built as a practical exercise after completing Jonas Schmedtmann's course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" on Udemy. It was inspired by his "mapty-app" idea, but the code has been heavily modified and differs greatly in structure, execution, and language (TypeScript instead of JavaScript).



## Technologies Used
- Typescript 4.9.4
- Node.js (for npm etc)
- SASS extension for CSS
- [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) as package bundler
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library for interactive map
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) providing the map data
- [Nominatin OSM](https://nominatim.org/) for reverse geocoding
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) for icons
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) for icons


## Features and Usage
- User may interact with a map to create and view markers with locations of restaurants
- The sidebar menu display articles including information, rating etc.
- User may edit the information, change icon or delete item
- The data is stored locally in the browser and is available after reload
- It is possible to filter and search articles in the list
- Automatically calculates position based on current position

## Acknowledgements
**Jonas Schmedtmann**
Project ideas are based from his Udemy course "[The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)". Specifically the projects: mapty-app and forkify. For this reason I cannot claim total copyright of the code. Although it is heavily modified, built upon and written with typescript.
